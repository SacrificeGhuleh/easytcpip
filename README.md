# Overview
- Basic code and idea of this project is based on stackoverflow answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/25256572 about UDP client on Windows OS.

- Build of the project is managed with CMake system

# TODO
- Implementation of TCP and UDP protocols
- Implementation of examples
- Multithreading with std::thread / std::async
